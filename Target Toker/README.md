# Find the Target Toker: Targeted Marketing for Dispensaries

This project aims to identify the subset of cannabis consumers that dispensaries should target with marketing campaigns. After the 'target toker' is identified, a model is built to classify the her using demographic features. The primary data set for this analysis is the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and can be found here: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2016-nsduh-2016-ds0001-nid17185
